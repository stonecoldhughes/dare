Implement:
    
    1. Busy-waiting for clip times
    2. Class factory generator

    you'll want a map of fake data objects.

    fake_data_bank[CORE_WHATEVER][thread_num]

    You need to be able to ignore certain core_blas types.
    For example, all the little ones called inside of an SVD
    or QR.

    Create a base class that returns proper objects
    Maybe template it?
